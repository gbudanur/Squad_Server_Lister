# Squad_Server_Lister
## This bot will help you track your favorite Squad servers without launching the game. It uses Steam Web API to get active Squad server data.
You can add the IP address of the server you'd like to keep track of via the box in the app and edit current servers as well as your Steam API key in the Server_cache.json file. You can get an API key at https://steamcommunity.com/dev/apikey.
